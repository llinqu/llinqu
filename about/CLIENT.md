# llinqu is 100% client-end

**With _no_ servers and _no_ back-end, llinqu is the _best_ client-end minifier you will _ever_ find.**

---

## Why do we do this?

The reason why we have kept llinqu as a client-end only application, is because it is far quicker and simpler.

## How do we do this?

The way that we have managed to create a front-end only minifier, is by using simple javascript algos in the [public/app/scripts/](../public/app/scripts) directory.
