Scroll down to read **About Us** and **Open Source**. Or click **Launch App** to open the app.

## App

In the llinqu app, it will ask you to select a langauge to minify in. If the language that you want is not on this list, use the **Universal Minifier** which generally remove comments, unnecessary spaces and whitespace.

When you select a language or use universal minifier, the minifying page will load. If there is an error, a error modal will show. If not, you will see a (monoco) editor on the left and a read only editor on the right; as shown below:

If you start typing/pasting code into the left editor, you will see the minified version of the code appear in the right read only editor.

In the menu you can navigate back to the language selection page and also refresh the minifier.
